# Quality Metrics

## Metrics That Matter

- Test failure rate
- Flaky test percentage
- Mean time to detect (MTTD)
- Mean time to recover (MTTR)

## Metrics We Ignore

- Code coverage %
- Number of tests
- Test execution vanity metrics

Quality is measured by **incidents avoided**, not by dashboards.
